# String Things

What's a String? Is that complicated? It sounds like something from advanced physics...

Well, not really. Strings are just text. Letters, numbers, spaces, special characters. Words and phrases, or a secret code, or total gibberish. English, or maybe some other language.

"But wait," you're thinking. "I thought programming was all about math!"

Well, not really. In the daily grind of most programmers, you do very little math, and not much with numbers. Strings play a much more fundamental role in most software developers' work.

Even if math is your fort√©, and you're planning to write hardcore math or science programs, or dive deep into hardware, I still think you should start with Strings. Strings are the interface between our programs and the people who use them. Any time you want to take input from a user, or output information to the user, it will be in the form of a String. And I want to make it *extremely* clear that nothing you do in programming will be remotely useful unless someone, a real living person, can use it.

Math may or may not be useful, depending on your domain. But you will always need the humble String. Make sure it's a friend, and a good one at that.
